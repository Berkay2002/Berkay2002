# Hej! I'm Berkay Orhan 👋

I am a **5th-year M.Sc. Media Technology & Engineering** student at Linköping University. I specialize in building high-performance systems, ranging from cloud-based AI agents to low-level graphics engines.

### 🔭 Current Focus: Master's Thesis (Exjobb)
I am currently developing an **Agentic GraphRAG system** for test scope analysis within the telecommunications industry. This involves leveraging LLMs, Knowledge Graphs, and autonomous agents to optimize complex software testing workflows.
